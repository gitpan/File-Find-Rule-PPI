NAME
    File::Find::Rule::PPI - Add support for PPI queries to File::Find::Rule

SYNOPSIS
      use File::Find::Rule      ();
      use File::Find::Rule::PPI ();

      # Find all perl modules that use here-docs
      my $Find = File::Find::Rule->file
                                 ->name('*.pm')
                                 ->ppi_find_any('Token::HereDoc');
      my @heredoc = $Find->in( $dir );

DESCRIPTION
    File::Find::Rule::PPI allows you to integrate PPI content queries into
    your File::Find::Rule searches.

    Initially, it provides the one additional method "ppi_find_any", which
    takes an argument identical to the PPI::Node method "find_any" and
    checks each file as a perl document to see if matches the query.

METHODS
  ppi_find_any $condition | $PPI::Find
    The "ppi_find_any" method causes a query identical to (and implemented
    using) PPI::Node's "find_any" method.

    It takes as argument any condition that would also be valid for the
    above method.

    In addition, it can also take as argument an instantiated PPI::Find
    object, and will use that object's "any_matches" method to achieve the
    same effect.

    If you provide no or an illegal condition to ppi_find_any, the check
    will always fail, and no files will be returned when you execute the
    search.

    Bugs should always be submitted via the CPAN bug tracker
